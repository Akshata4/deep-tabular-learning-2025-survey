# Deep Tabular Learning 2025 – Survey and Analysis

> **CMPE 255 – Data Mining | Short Story Assignment**

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for the **Short Story Assignment** based on the 2025 survey paper  
**“Deep Learning within Tabular Data: Foundations, Challenges, and Advances.”**

The work explores how **Deep Learning** methods are transforming **tabular (structured) data mining** — a core area of data science.  
It summarizes the **architectures, benchmarks, and interpretability techniques** that bridge the gap between traditional machine learning (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forests) and modern deep models (e.g., FT-Transformer, TabNet, SAINT, TabPFN).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Study the **foundations and challenges** of deep learning on tabular data.  
- Compare **modern architectures** and their data-mining relevance.  
- Analyze **ablation studies, datasets, and evaluation metrics**.  
- Summarize key **open challenges** and future research directions.  
- Translate academic insights into an accessible **Medium article** and **presentation**.
